# DIAsDEM Workbench 2.2 (http://www.hypKNOWsys.org)
#
# After setting the following two environment variables, DIAsDEMgui -- the 
# interactive graphic user interface of the DIAsDEM Workbench -- can be
# launched using this shell script. Make ${DIAsDEM_HOME}/bin your current
# working directory and submit the following command at the system prompt:
#
# prompt% ./diasdemgui
#
# The first environment variable JAVA_HOME contains the absolute path to
# the Java directory. It must be adjusted according to your system.
# Example: JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/j2sdk1.4.0_01
#
# The second environment variable DIAsDEM_HOME contains the path of the
# DIAsDEM installation. This directory contains the sub-directories /bin,
# /data, /doc and /lib. After starting the tool for the first time, this 
# directory will also contain the file DIAsDEMgui.config as well. This
# environment variable must be adjusted according to the installation of
# the DIAsDEM Workbench. 
# Example: DIAsDEM_HOME=/home/user1/DIAsDEM.workbench22
#
# Note: You may have to adjust the size of memory allocated to the Java
# Virtual Machine in the environment variable DIAsDEM_JAVA_OPTIONS (-ms:
# size at start of JVM resp. -mx: maximum size). The size of two stacks
# used by the JVM (-ss resp. -oss) can be changed as well. See the Java
# tools documentation for details.


DIAsDEM_HOME=/users/yourNamePath/DIAsDEM.workbench22
JAVA_HOME=/usr/yourJavaPath


# Please do not modify the following lines without appropriate knowledge.
# Note that the memory allocated to the Java virtual machine corresponds 
# is appropriate for a computer with 256 MB RAM. Note that two TreeTagger
# directories must be included in the environment variable PATH before
# starting the DIAsDEM Workbench. TreeTagger is available for Linux and 
# Solaris. Simply ask google.com for the keywords 'TreeTagger download'.
