# This file contains terms along with potential term sense definitions. The disambiguation
# algorithm is inspired by the section 'Diasambiguation based on sense definitions' on pp.
# 242-244 in Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Schuetze: Foundations of Statistical Natural
# Language Processing. MIT Press, 2001. The sense of terms (i.e., tokens without blanks) is
# determined as follows: If there is only one sense s1 defined for a token, at least one
# sense indicator token must occur in the specified context to tag the token as s1. A token
# is tagged by appending the sense tag to the token itself: token := token + sense_tag. If
# there are n senses s1, ..., sn defined for a token, the sense si (i = 1, ..., n) is chosen
# that has most (but at least one) occurences of indicator tokens in the context of the token.
# If two or more senses have the same number of indicator term occurrences, the first sense
# tag is chosen. The context of counting sense indicator token occurrences is determined as
# follows: Context = 0 defines the entire text unit as context, whereas Context = 1, 2, ..., n
# defines the respective number of tokens that precede and follow the token to be disambiguated
# as context. The non-empty list of sense indicator tokens is separated by commas without blank
# spaces. Sense indicators can be strings like <<number>> that indicate named entity types.
