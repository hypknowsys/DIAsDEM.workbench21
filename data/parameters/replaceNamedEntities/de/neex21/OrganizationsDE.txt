# This file contains complete names of large organization with NEEX 2.1 
# (Actions -> Prepare Data Set -> Replace Named Entities 2.1) only. NEEX 
# 2.1 can process both single- (e.g., 'Adidas') and multi-token organizations
# containing for example blank spaces (e.g., 'Adidas - Salomon'). They are 
# processed case-sensitively. Hence, the organization 'Adidas' will not match
# the term 'ADIDAS'. All organizations containing full stops must be listed 
# in the file ${PARAMETER_DIRECTORY}/createTextUnits/de/AbbreviationsDE.txt 
# to ensure correct sentence splits. Organizations containing special 
# characters such as 'Adidas-Salomon' or 'E.ON' must be entered in their 
# tokenized form 'Adidas - Salomon' or 'E.ON'. Note, 'E.ON' is a abbreviation 
# listed in ${PARAMETER_DIRECTORY}/createTextUnits/de/AbbreviationsDE.txt.
# Include organizations in this file, if their occurrences without known
# organiaztion suffixes have to be extracted or if they include terms listed
# in the file containing organization indicators.
