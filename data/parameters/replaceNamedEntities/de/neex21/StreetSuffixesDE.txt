# This file contains frequently occuring suffixes of street names for usage
# with NEEX 2.1 (Actions -> Prepare Data Set -> Replace Named Entities 2.1)
# only. Capitalized tokens are assumed to be a street name candidate, if they
# end with or solely consist of a suffix listed in this file. Street name
# suffixes are not processed case-sensitively. Hence, the suffix 'straße'
# will also match the street 'MUSTERSTRAßE' and 'Straße'. Street name
# suffixes should be ordered by their decreasing frequency for performance
# reasons.
