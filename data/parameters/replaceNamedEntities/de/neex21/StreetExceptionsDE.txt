# This file contains frequently occuring street names that do not end with a
# typical street name suffix for usage with NEEX 2.1 (Actions -> Prepare Data
# Set -> Replace Named Entities 2.1) only. NEEX 2.1 can process both single-
# (e.g., 'Bohnenberg') and multi-token street names containing for example
# blank spaces (e.g., 'Im Grund'). Street names listed in this file are
# processed case-sensitively. Hence, the street name 'Bohnenberg' will not
# match the term 'bohnenberg'. Street names containing special characters
# such as '/' or '-' must be entered in their tokenized form. To that end,
# the DIAsDEM task Actions -> Miscellaneous -> Tokenize Parameter Text File
# might be employed. Note, this list should be extended for real-world
# applications.
