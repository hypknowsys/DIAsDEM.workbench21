# This file contains frequently occuring name affixes for usage with 
# NEEX 2.1 (Actions -> Prepare Data Set -> Replace Named Entities 2.1) 
# only. NEEX 2.1 can process both single- (e.g., 'jun.') and multi-
# token name affixes containing for example blank spaces (e.g., ', jun.').
# Name affixes are processed case-sensitively. Hence, the affix 'Ph.D.' 
# will not match the term 'PH.D.'. Name affixes containing special 
# characters such as ',jun.' or 'Ph.D.' must be entered in their tokenized
# form ', jun.' or 'Ph.D.' as both 'jun.' and 'Ph.D.' are contained in the 
# list of known German abbreviations. To that end, the DIAsDEM task Actions 
# -> Miscellaneous -> Tokenize Parameter Text File might be employed.
