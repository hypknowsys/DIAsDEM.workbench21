# This file contains frequent organization suffixes for usage with NEEX 
# 2.0 (Actions -> Prepare Data Set -> Replace Named Entities 2.0) only. 
# NEEX 2.0 can only process single-token organization suffixes which do 
# not contain blank spaces. Organization suffixes are processed case-
# sensitively. Hence, the second suffix 'KG' will not match the term 'kg'.
# Note, the first term 'GmbH_&_Co._KG' is a multi-token term whose real
# counterpart 'GmbH & Co. KG' is listed in the file ${PARAMETER_DIRECTORY}
# /tokenizeTextUnits/de/neex20/MultiTokenWordsDE.txt. All suffixes of 
# organizations containing full stops such as 'e.Kfr.' must be listed in
# the file ${PARAMETER_DIRECTORY}/createTextUnits/de/AbbreviationsDE.txt
# to ensure correct sentence splits.
